Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room has a successful mobile application for their game "Draw It or Lose It". My assignment is to perform the task commissioned
  by the client to create a web-based application for their game to expand their platform. The requirements include functionality and the 
  ability to store massive data for pictures, and real-time interactions between players. Ability to create teams and players for that team. 
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I performed thorough research for the assignment that included both textbook and web searches.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Developing the design document provided a map for me to follow that made coding directional and concise. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  The technology is ever changing and improving. I would do more research in comparing actual technology available to suffice the requirements of the client.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The user will be the client's guest audience. That is their target market. A great experience means more audience and a successful platform. Considering the 
  user's needs simply sums up a typical business transaction. If they are met, a happy user becomes a happy long term user and potentially a promoter.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  My strategy will be simple. Being in a client headspace, meeting their needs and making sure that I meet all their user requirements above and beyong my
  programs capability will be a returning client. I can better structure my approach. For example: First day, review client requirements. Learn the client and 
  their prospective target market. Do research and get input from target users. Do a rough draft. Run a simple test. Then finalize Design for submission.
